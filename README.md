Ben Thomas' JavaScript Resume. I completed this as Project 2 of the Udacity Front End Web Developer Nanodegree program. 

# **Project Overview**

Built resume by writing a JS script that used objects containing personal information to push data into Udacity provided html/css templates. Through coursework and project completion gained understanding of basic JavaScript syntax, data manipulation, function/loop creation, and simple jQuery DOM manipulation methods. 

## How to "Run"

To run this project simply open the "index.html" file in a browser of your choice.
